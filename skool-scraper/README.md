## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Proxy Setup

For enhanced reliability and to avoid IP blocking:

```json
{
  "proxyConfig": {
    "useApifyProxy": true,
    "apifyProxyGroups": ["RESIDENTIAL"],
    "apifyProxyCountry": "US"
  }
}
```

### Performance Tuning

For large communities, optimize performance:

```json
{
  "maxConcurrency": 5,
  "requestDelay": 3,
  "scrollDelay": 3,
  "includeComments": false
}
```

For faster scraping of smaller communities:

```json
{
  "maxConcurrency": 20,
  "requestDelay": 1,
  "scrollDelay": 1
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**Error**: "Authentication failed"
- ‚úÖ Ensure you're logged into Skool.com
- ‚úÖ Export fresh cookies (they expire regularly)
- ‚úÖ Verify cookies include session tokens
- ‚úÖ Check that cookies are from the correct domain

**Error**: "Access denied"
- ‚úÖ Confirm you're a member of the community
- ‚úÖ Try accessing the community manually in your browser
- ‚úÖ Some communities may have posting restrictions

### Scraping Issues

**Problem**: No posts found
- ‚úÖ Check if the community has public posts
- ‚úÖ Verify the URL format: `https://www.skool.com/community-name`
- ‚úÖ Try the "classroom" tab if "community" tab is empty

**Problem**: Rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Increase `requestDelay` and `scrollDelay`
- ‚úÖ Reduce `maxConcurrency`
- ‚úÖ Enable proxy configuration

**Problem**: Memory issues
- ‚úÖ Reduce `maxItems` per community
- ‚úÖ Set `includeComments` to false for large communities
- ‚úÖ Process fewer communities per run

## üìù Best Practices

### Ethical Scraping
- Only scrape communities you're legitimately a member of
- Respect rate limits and don't overwhelm Skool's servers
- Use reasonable delays between requests
- Consider the community guidelines and Terms of Service

### Data Management
- Regularly export your dataset to avoid data loss
- Use descriptive run names for organization
- Monitor memory usage for large scraping jobs
- Implement data validation before analysis

### Performance Optimization
- Start with small test runs to verify configuration
- Use proxies for reliability and avoiding blocks
- Batch process large communities
- Schedule runs during off-peak hours
